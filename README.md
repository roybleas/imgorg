Image Organiser

I wanted to set the filenames of some holiday photographs so they would display on the TV in the correct sequence. I did this manually for the first few and then decided to write this sinatra program.

It is not sophisticated and not intended for multiusers as anyone can save the files.

I run the program locally. Copy photographs into the gallery folder. Order them into the sequence I want, and save.

Anoyances: The browser will cache the files so after saving it seems if nothing has changed. If I sort about 20 photographs at a time it works OK.
